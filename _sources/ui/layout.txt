Layout
======

There are a variety of ways to layout widgets in `zoof.ui`. The most
common is to align things horizonaltally or vertically using a box layout.
A form layout can also be convenient. For more control there is a grid,
and for more flexibility there is PinBoard layout.


.. note::
    These examples are all working code. When building the docs, the
    Python code of the examples is executed and the resulting app is
    exported to a standalone html file. These html files are displayed
    in this page in iframes. In a proper browser the example apps can
    be resized.


No layout
---------

Let's start by looking at what would happen without any layout. We just
create an app with three buttons. 

.. UIExample:: 100
    
    from zoof import ui
    
    class MyApp(ui.App):
        def init(self):
            self.b1 = ui.Button(self, 'Hello world')
            self.b2 = ui.Button(self, 'Foo')
            self.b3 = ui.Button(self, 'Bar')

What happens is that this is HTML, so the buttons will simply be placed
after each-other until they no longer fit on one row. By applying
appropriate styling you can make them each appear on a line, or e.g. 
``float: left``. But real GUI-like layout is best done using actual
layout classes!


HBox and VBox
-------------

With the `HBox` class, you can layout widgets horizontally. Note the use of
the flex argument. It determines how the widget is stretched. A flex of 0
means to not stretch, but use the minimal sensible width.

.. UIExample:: 100
    from zoof import ui
    
    class MyApp(ui.App):
        def init(self):
            with ui.HBox(self):
                self.b1 = ui.Button(text='Hola', flex=0)
                self.b2 = ui.Button(text='Hello world', flex=1)
                self.b3 = ui.Button(text='Foo bar', flex=2)


You can see how the layout is used as context manager. Inside this
context, the elements do not have to specify the parent, since the
layout automatically becomes the parent. A nice side-effect is that the
source gets structured in a way that reflects the structure of the
elements.


The `VBox` class is similar to the `HBox`, except now the widgets are
aligned vertically. Note how we don't specify a flex here, effectively 
giving the buttons a flex of 0. 

.. UIExample:: 100
    from zoof import ui
    
    class MyApp(ui.App):
        def init(self):
            with ui.VBox(self):
                self.b1 = ui.Button(text='Hola')
                self.b2 = ui.Button(text='Hello world')
                self.b3 = ui.Button(text='Foo bar')
                ui.Widget(flex=1)

In the above app, we use an empty widget as a spacer. This is because
the VBox and HBox always want to fill their space. If we would not put
the stub widged at the end, all elements would be stretched to fill up
the whole space.

.. UIExample:: 100
    from zoof import ui
    
    class MyApp(ui.App):
        def init(self):
            with ui.VBox(self):
                self.b1 = ui.Button(text='Hola')
                self.b2 = ui.Button(text='Hello world')
                self.b3 = ui.Button(text='Foo bar')

One difference you can observe between HBox and VBox is that the
elements in the VBox get fully stretched horizontally, while the elements
in a HBox do *not* get stretched vertically. This is because elements
(e.g. buttons) still look ok when they are wider than necessary, but look
strange when they are higher than necessary. We may add arguments to the
layout to influence this behavior.

Now for a more complex example. A couple of HBox'es in a VBox, to show
some possible variations. Also note how this syntax for writing out the
layout leads to a clear structure that corresponds to how the the
widgets are organized.

.. UIExample:: 300
    
    from zoof import ui
    
    class MyApp(ui.App):
        def init(self):
            with ui.VBox(self):
                
                ui.Label(text='Flex 0 0 0')
                with ui.HBox(flex=0):
                    self.b1 = ui.Button(text='Hola', flex=0)
                    self.b2 = ui.Button(text='Hello world', flex=0)
                    self.b3 = ui.Button(text='Foo bar', flex=0)
                
                ui.Label(text='Flex 1 0 3')
                with ui.HBox(flex=0):
                    self.b1 = ui.Button(text='Hola', flex=1)
                    self.b2 = ui.Button(text='Hello world', flex=0)
                    self.b3 = ui.Button(text='Foo bar', flex=3)
                
                ui.Label(text='margin 10 (around layout)')
                with ui.HBox(flex=0, margin=10):
                    self.b1 = ui.Button(text='Hola', flex=1)
                    self.b2 = ui.Button(text='Hello world', flex=1)
                    self.b3 = ui.Button(text='Foo bar', flex=1)
                
                ui.Label(text='spacing 10 (inter-widget)')
                with ui.HBox(flex=0, spacing=10):
                    self.b1 = ui.Button(text='Hola', flex=1)
                    self.b2 = ui.Button(text='Hello world', flex=1)
                    self.b3 = ui.Button(text='Foo bar', flex=1)
                
                ui.Widget(flex=1)
                ui.Label(text='Note the spacer Widget above')



Form 
----

The Form layout is a specific case of the Grid layout (which will be
discussed next). It is a very convenient layout when you have a buncg
of widgets (or labels) next to labels to describe them. Like in a form.

As you can see, you simply specify the elements, and each pair of elements
is placed on a row. The left row has an implicit flex of zero, and the right
row an implicit flex of 1. To not stretch the rows, we add a simple stretcher
element at the end. In the Form layout, the specified flex applies to
the vertical direction.

.. UIExample:: 200
    
    from zoof import ui
    
    class MyApp(ui.App):
        def init(self):
            with ui.Form(self):
                ui.Label(text='Pet name:')
                self.b1 = ui.Button(text='Hola')
                ui.Label(text='Pet Age:')
                self.b2 = ui.Button(text='Hello world')
                ui.Label(text='Pet\'s Favorite color:')
                self.b3 = ui.Button(text='Foo bar')
                ui.Widget(flex=1)


Grid
----

The Grid layout provides a way to layout elements in a grid. It is quite
flexible, but less easier to use then the above layouts. In many cases you can
get a way with a bunch of HBoxes and VBoxes, and/or a Form layout. Otherwise,
here's how Grid works.

Each element needs a `pos` argument that is a tuple of two integers
that specify the position within the grid to place the element. Flex
values can also be given, but here they are tuples: they specify the
flex for width and height, respectively.

.. UIExample:: 300
    
    from zoof import ui
    
    class MyApp(ui.App):
        def init(self):
            with ui.Grid(self):
                self.b1 = ui.Button(text='No flex', pos=(0, 0))
                self.b2 = ui.Button(text='Hola', pos=(1, 1), flex=(1, 1))
                self.b3 = ui.Button(text='Hello world', pos=(2, 2), flex=(2, 1))
                self.b4 = ui.Button(text='Foo bar', pos=(4, 4), flex=(1, 2))
                self.b5 = ui.Button(text='no flex again', pos=(5, 5))
        



PinBoard
--------

*Name is subject to change*

The PinBoard layout free layout without any form of alignment. Elements
are given a certain position and that's where they'll be. The position
must be specified via the `pos` argument. When it is larger than 1, it
is in pixels. When it is smaller than 1, it is regarded a fractional
position (i.e. as in a percentage of the parent size).

.. UIExample:: 300
    
    from zoof import ui
    
    class MyApp(ui.App):
        def init(self):
            with ui.PinBoard(self):
                self.b1 = ui.Button(text='Stuck at (20, 20)', pos=(20, 30))
                self.b2 = ui.Button(text='Dynamic at (20%, 20%)', pos=(0.2, 0.2))
                self.b3 = ui.Button(text='Dynamic at (50%, 70%)', pos=(0.5, 0.7))



HSplit
------

The HSplit horizontally splits the available space in regions, which
size can be set by the user by dragging the divider.

At the moment, the splitter can only have two children, but eventually,
it will be able to hold any number of children.

.. UIExample:: 300
    
    from zoof import ui
    
    class MyApp(ui.App):
        def init(self):
            with ui.HSplit(self):
                self.b1 = ui.Button(text='At the left')
                self.b2 = ui.Button(text='At the right')
