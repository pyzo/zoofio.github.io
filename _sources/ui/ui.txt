Zoof.ui
=======

``zoof.ui`` is an *experimental* GUI framework that uses web technology to
create rich apps in a Pythonic way. It can create standalone desktop
applications, as well as host (multi-user) web apps.

This code is currently developed as part of the Zoof project,
but should probably have its own repo at some point.
