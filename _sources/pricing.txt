Zoof pricing
------------

**Let's make this clear: Zoof is free and always will be.**

We are still figuring out the exact business model, but in any case the
free version of Zoof will be open source, freely available and without
any restrcitions in functionality.

    With Support Basic you get priority support and we provide a
    new binary of Zoof when necessary. With Support Pro we do what we can
    to help solve your problem with any of the packages that make up
